i build small systems to understand how software works at a low level: memory, rendering, search, and performance.<br><br>

my current project:
1. [spheni](https://github.com/datavorous/spheni): a vector search library for python written in C++
2. [froginfer](https://github.com/datavorous/froginfer): an inference runtime for llama 2 models, to be built on top of frogemm and frogtensor
3. [frogemm](https://github.com/datavorous/frogemm): a small GEMM library for fast matrix multiplications in C
